## 📌 About the Capstone

In today's data-centric world, organizations rely on skilled analysts to transform raw data into actionable insights. This capstone project was the final step in the **IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate**, designed to simulate real-world data analysis tasks from start to finish.

Throughout the project, I applied the core skills and tools covered in the program to analyze data from the **Stack Overflow Developer Survey**. The project involved:

- Data Collection from external sources  
- Data Wrangling and Cleaning using **Pandas**  
- Exploratory and Statistical Analysis  
- Interactive Dashboards in **IBM Cognos**  
- Final report preparation for executive stakeholders
